Purpose:  setup a MySQL database connection between your javaEE project and a localhost MySQL database

Note Tomcat and Glassfish servers are different.  See entity-mappings project and Eclipse version of context.xml
for basic Tomcat server setup.  for Glassfish (ver 4 specifically) see links in Details section below:
Note this assumes you have a localhost glassfish and MySQL instance already setup

Quick Start:
1) [entirely new setup on glassfish]  download connector/j jar [zip].  
	Unzip, copy jar to GLASSFISH_HOME/glassfish/domain/domain1/lib folder
	glassfish server for changes to take effect
	mySQL/Java connector link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
2) Restart glassfish server for changes to take effect
3) Glasfish admin console [localhost:4848/] JDBC Connection Pool. Create name, accept basics, add DB username and password- see links 
  for addtl details.  ping- make sure it connects successfully.
4) admin console- JDBC Resources- JNDI name.  This has to be setup also to the table you want to use 'jdbc/[table]' associated to pool
	you just setup.
5) create java/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml folder/file
6) programtically test connection via java



Details
1) helpful setup links:
  -https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/5.1/en/connector-j-usagenotes-glassfish-config.html
  -https://javatutorial.net/configure-glassfish-mysql
  -note that on 2nd link it incorrectly has you copying jar to bin folder- this is wrong.  when you try to set it up in connection pool
  you will get a lot less attributes, and link will create but ping [connection] will fail.  jar file must be in domain specific lib folder.
2) Note that tomcat [eclipse server] context.xml and the glassfish connection pool/jndi have similar db connection info.  the 2 roughly
 correspond, but have the detailed info in different places.
3)Note this requires mySQL to be up and running.  on localhost this server starts automatically when machine is turned on.  but 
  regardless of local or its own server- it has to be up and running.

5)Note that this is a standard folder and NOT a java package.  right click/new/other/folder, then add persistence.xml file
