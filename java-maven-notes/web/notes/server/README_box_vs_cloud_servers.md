Purpose:  the focus of this folder set if either localhost (pc) or independently managed web server (which I dont have yet).
for Cloud based webservers (AWS, Google, Azure) see the cloud folderset.


Quick Start: 
[none]- see other readmes under this folder.

Details:
1) I do have a re-purposed PC loaded with linix ubuntu14, and a small raspberry pi unit that could act as a web server on my
local network but as of Mar-2018 they are not fully established.  And as I have learned over time, it is not a trivial task.
2) https: particulary https seems specifically difficult to setup on a local machine, and may have better luck using cloud services.
  I have got several webserver and https books, but havent got to the point yet of beinig able to actually complete the setup.
