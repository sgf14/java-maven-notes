Purpose:
See /web/notes folder for scope specific README files.  This is the initial purpose of this project.
  Over time may expand this for useful code sample and testing as well.

Details:
wanted a project to house notes that could act as a reminder of 
1) how to establish a new java project.  Since you are not necessarily creating entirely new projects often
  focus is on web based Java projects using Maven as build process
  includes setup in local Git and web based Git hub projects for change management and remote storage
  the different README files are setup typically with a Quick start guide and then more detailed information below.
2) to hold commonly used files ie pom.xml, log4j.xml and persistence.xml that can be used as templates, or basic starting point.
3) Structure:  This project was created as a j2ee maven project.  But at this time there is no executable java code in the project.
  It is only intended to hold reference material- mainly .md files- as described above.
4) Notes subfolders:  Within /web/notes there are a series of folders by subject, as a means of organizing related concepts.
